Reason for this map: 
	I chose this map because i live in Egypt, Cairo.

Description:
	I was quite excited that i found my city in the metro extracts. So i decided i should look into how cairo is mapped in the Open Street Map project. The file size wasn't too big, so i guess that made my decision even easier.
